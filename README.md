# Pico Explorer Things

This repo has my tinkerings that use the Pico Explorer by Pimoroni to test and understand the Raspberry Pi Pico platform via MicroPython.

## New Device Setup

- Install Pimoroni's version of MicroPython from https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico by following their guide.
- Clone and open this repo with VS Code and install the recommended extensions.

## Running Code

- Open a file and use the MicroPico extension to run in on a connected Pico.
